## Description
* This repository provides a Python implementation of the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm, inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting behavior of grey wolves.
* The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy of alpha, beta, and gamma wolves to iteratively search for optimal solutions in various optimization problems.
* This implementation demonstrates how GWO can be applied to optimize a given objective function, utilizing encircling behavior and hierarchical leadership to converge towards the best solution.
